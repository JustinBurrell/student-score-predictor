## üöÄ Local Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API URL:**
   - Create a file called `.env` in the `frontend/` directory (do not commit this file).
   - Add this line:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
     ```
   - This tells the frontend to use your local backend during development.

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## üåê Production Deployment

- The API URL is set using the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable in your deployment platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
- Example for Vercel:
  - Key: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
  - Value: `https://student-score-predictor-api.onrender.com`
- The frontend will automatically use this value in production.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **API errors or CORS issues:**
  - Make sure your `.env` is set correctly for local dev.
  - For production, ensure the backend allows your frontend domain in its CORS settings.
- **Plots not loading:**
  - Check the browser console and network tab for failed requests.
  - Make sure the backend `/api/plots` endpoint is working and returns valid URLs.
- **Environment variable changes not taking effect:**
  - Restart the dev server after editing `.env`.
- **Testing against production backend:**
  - Temporarily set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in `.env` to the production backend URL.

---

## üß™ Testing

- **Run React tests:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Manual testing:**
  - Use the UI to submit predictions and view analysis plots.
  - Check the browser console for errors.
- **API health check:**
  - The frontend checks backend health on startup. If the backend is down, you'll see an error message.
