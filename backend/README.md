## ðŸ“¦ Machine Learning Implementation

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor with optimized hyperparameters
- **Models**: Three separate models for predicting math, reading, and writing scores
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust performance estimation
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Polynomial features for score relationships
  - Score differences and ratios
  - Educational and demographic interaction terms
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: 95% confidence intervals using tree variance
- **Model Versioning**: Semantic versioning (current: 1.0.0)
- **Performance Tracking**: Automated metrics collection and storage

### Model Training
- **Script:** `train_models.py` â€” Run this script to retrain all models or individual models with updated data or parameters.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  cd backend
  source ../.venv/bin/activate
  python train_models.py
  ```
- See the script for options and documentation.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Setup

### Local Development
1. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Server will start on port 5001 (http://localhost:5001)

### Production Deployment
- Set environment variables for CORS and API base URL in your deployment platform (e.g., Render):
  - `CORS_ORIGINS` â€” Comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins (e.g., your Vercel frontend URL)
  - `API_BASE_URL` â€” The public URL of your backend API
- For troubleshooting deployment, see [backend_troubleshooting.md](test_scripts/backend_troubleshooting.md)
- For advanced testing and CI/CD, see [testingdocumentation.md](test_scripts/testingdocumentation.md)
